## What is this

A (hopefully) helpful guide to users new to Hugo about what the differences are 
between `index.md`, `_index.md` and `lorem-ipsum.md`, and how these relate to 
what layout files are being used.

## Why tho

Every couple of weeks on the [Hugo forums](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) we get 
asked to clarify some aspect of the above. I want to make my life easier.
